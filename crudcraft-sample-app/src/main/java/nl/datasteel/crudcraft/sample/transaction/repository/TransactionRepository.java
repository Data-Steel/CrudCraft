/**
 * Generated Repository layer stub for Transaction.
 * @CrudCraft:generated
 * @CrudCraft:editable
 *
 * This Repository stub extends CrudCraft's base implementation. Override methods to customise behaviour.
 *
 * You are allowed to modify this file. It extends CrudCraft's abstract base (TransactionRepositoryBase)
 * which already implements full CRUD logic.
 *
 * This file was generated only once. CrudCraft will not overwrite it in future
 * builds. If you delete it, it will be regenerated.
 *
 * Features provided by CrudCraft:
 * - Standard CRUD workflow already implemented
 * - DTO mapping and repository calls wired up
 *
 * Generation context:
 * - Source model: Transaction
 * - Package: nl.datasteel.crudcraft.sample.transaction.repository
 * - Generator: RepositoryGenerator
 * - Generation time: 2025-09-02T09:10:33.9334971+02:00
 * - CrudCraft version: 0.1.0
 *
 * Recommendations:
 * - You may customize method behavior, add validation, or extend with additional endpoints.
 * - Signature changes are allowed, but may desync from service or mapper layerâ€”proceed with care.
 * - Do not manually copy or paste other CrudCraft stubs into this class.
 *
 * Support: For file generation bugs or feedback, open an issue at
 * https://github.com/Data-Steel/CrudCraft/issues.
