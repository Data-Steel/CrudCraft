# Endpoints & Bulk Operations

CrudCraft exposes a consistent REST surface for each `@CrudCrafted` entity. This guide lists the standard endpoints and explains the bulk operations available.

## Single-item Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/books` | List books with pagination and sorting |
| `POST` | `/books` | Create a new book |
| `GET` | `/books/{id}` | Retrieve a book by ID |
| `PUT` | `/books/{id}` | Replace a book |
| `PATCH` | `/books/{id}` | Partially update a book |
| `DELETE` | `/books/{id}` | Delete a book |

Pagination parameters `page`, `size`, and `sort` are supported on list endpoints. Sorting uses `property,asc|desc` notation.

## Bulk Endpoints

CrudCraft generates batch endpoints under the same resource path. Bulk requests accept arrays of DTOs and operate atomically per element.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/books/bulk` | Create many books |
| `PUT` | `/books/bulk` | Replace many books |
| `PATCH` | `/books/bulk` | Partially update many books |
| `DELETE` | `/books/bulk` | Delete many books by ID |
| `POST` | `/books/bulk/upsert` | Insert or update by ID |
| `POST` | `/books/bulk/validate` | Validate without persisting |

### Sample Bulk Request

```json
[
  {"title": "Spring in Action", "author": "Craig"},
  {"title": "Effective Java", "author": "Joshua"}
]
```

Each entry produces a separate response element with success or error details. Bulk responses mirror the request array order.

## Status Codes

- `200 OK` for successful GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- `201 Created` for single and bulk POST
- `207 Multi-Status` when bulk operations contain mixed results
